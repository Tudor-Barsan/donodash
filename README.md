*Where giving meets growth*

## 💡 Inspiration

In today's fast-paced world, where digital transformation is at the heart of societal evolution, the spirit of philanthropy remains a beacon of hope for many. However, the journey from the willingness to give to the act of donating is often cluttered with obstacles. Potential donors are met with an overwhelming array of choices, lack of transparency, and a disconnection from the impact of their contributions. Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs), on the other hand, grapple with visibility, funding shortages, and the challenge of conveying their mission to a wider audience. This gap between intent and action, visibility and impact, inspired the creation of DonoDash.


## 🔍 What is DonoDash

Donodash redefines the donor experience by centralizing the ability to browse and support a diverse array of charities. It eliminates the need to navigate through multiple websites and platforms, offering a unified space where individuals can find causes that resonate with them. This convenience is amplified by the platform's additional features, which include:
### For Donors
Donation Tracking, Analytics, Rewards, Tax Document Tracking.

### For Charities
Marketing, Charity Statistics, Partnerships

## ⚙️ How we built it

Our site is built with React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS on the frontend, with Node.js and Express on the backend. We integrated Stripe's API capabilities to handle a seamless and secure payment experience for donors. We also integrated OpenAI's API within our chatbot Dono to provide users with charity-related information.

## 🚧 Challenges we ran into

Integrating Stripe payments into the Donodash platform presented several challenges that required thoughtful solutions and technical finesse to overcome. Effectively drilling in donation information into the Stripe payment page was difficult, however, by drilling type-safe data objects into our post requests, we were able to effectively implement our payments. 

## ✔️ What we're proud of

- The integration of Stripe and OpenAI API's to allow for extended functionality
- Our entire user experience from sign-in --> charity search --> charity pages --> dashboard analytics

## 🔭 What's next for DonoDash

As DonoDash continues to evolve, our roadmap is focused on expanding our impact, enhancing user experience, and introducing innovative features that further simplify the donation process while maximizing the benefits for both donors and charities. 
- DonoDash plans to extend its reach beyond its current operational boundaries, targeting a global audience. This includes localizing the platform in multiple languages and ensuring compliance with international donation and tax regulations.
